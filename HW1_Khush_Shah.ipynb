    "The selection sort algorithm needs to run only for the first (n - 1) elements because after these iterations, the nth element will already be in its correct position. This is due to the property of selection sort that after each pass, the smallest (or largest, depending on the sorting order) element in the unsorted portion of the array is placed at the end of the sorted portion. Therefore, when there's only one element left, it must be in the correct position since all other elements are sorted.\n"
